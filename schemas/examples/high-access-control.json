  "description": "The setOwner() function lacks proper access control mechanisms, allowing any user to change the contract owner. This vulnerability could lead to complete contract takeover and unauthorized access to privileged functions.",

    "summary": "Implement proper access control using OpenZeppelin's Ownable pattern or custom modifier to restrict access to authorized users only",
    "details": "1. Add onlyOwner modifier to restrict access to current owner\n2. Implement two-step ownership transfer process for safety\n3. Add event emission for ownership changes\n4. Consider using OpenZeppelin's AccessControl for more granular permissions\n5. Review all administrative functions for similar issues",
    "code_example": "import \"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol\";\n\ncontract SecureContract is Ownable {\n    function setOwner(address newOwner) external onlyOwner {\n        require(newOwner != address(0), \"Invalid owner\");\n        _transferOwnership(newOwner);\n    }\n    \n    // Or use two-step process\n    function proposeOwner(address newOwner) external onlyOwner {\n        pendingOwner = newOwner;\n        emit OwnershipProposed(newOwner);\n    }\n    \n    function acceptOwnership() external {\n        require(msg.sender == pendingOwner, \"Not pending owner\");\n        _transferOwnership(pendingOwner);\n        pendingOwner = address(0);\n    }\n}",

echo "🚀 Testing Complete Sentiment Pipeline: Text → Google Cloud NLP → Daily Aggregates\n\n";

echo "📋 Pipeline Test Configuration:\n";
echo "  • Text samples: " . count($testTexts) . "\n";
echo "  • Platform: " . $testMetadata['platform'] . "\n";
echo "  • Category: " . $testMetadata['keyword_category'] . "\n";
echo "  • Language: " . $testMetadata['language'] . "\n";
echo "  • Batch name: " . $testMetadata['batch_name'] . "\n\n";

echo "📝 Sample texts for processing:\n";

echo "⚡ Pipeline Processing Steps:\n";
echo "  1. Create sentiment batch record\n";
echo "  2. Process texts through Google Cloud NLP API\n";
echo "  3. Store individual sentiment results\n";
echo "  4. Generate daily sentiment aggregates\n";
echo "  5. Complete batch with processing summary\n\n";

echo "📊 Expected Output:\n";
echo "  • Batch processing results with sentiment scores\n";
echo "  • Daily aggregate metrics (avg sentiment, counts, percentages)\n";
echo "  • Processing statistics and performance metrics\n";
echo "  • Quality scoring and validation results\n\n";

echo "🔧 To run this test with the actual Laravel application:\n";
echo "  docker compose exec app php test_sentiment_pipeline.php\n\n";
